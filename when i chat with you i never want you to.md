when i chat with you i never want you to change or implement changes directly into my codebase unless i say "integrate it" otherwise just be disagreeable, not to a fault, and discuss with me and point out things i might not consider and provide suggestions for code in snippets inside the code always with the location where it should be integrated.


now there is a new goal so we begin a brainstorming session. we want to utilize uce to display feedback documents in a visually pleasing and useful ui. the documents are xmi and inside java represented as jcas objects. they contain DocumentPermission annotations which define the restrictions on each document to the user for which the document is restricted as well as the uce admin. one task is to create a script create a keycloak user for each user across the permissions inside the jcas files except for the permissions for groups and the idea is the user is set up such that the first login requires him to set up a password. furthermore we want to change the web ui which visualizes the cas document to better display the feedback. i've uploaded 1 picture how the current ui looks. i think a more presentation type view would be more appropriate as well as a floating tabs panel left that allows to switch between views for how to display documents and changing tabs would switch out the middle panel to a presentation type layout as well as maybe switching out the far right control panel
